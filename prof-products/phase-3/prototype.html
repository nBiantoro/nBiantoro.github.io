                    <h3>Version 0</h3>

                    <p>

                        The version 0 of the prototype includes both management platform and consumer application. The
                        design choices were made based on Tailwind CSS layouts and color schemes have also been made to
                        follow. This was done for the rest of the iterations to allow quicker and easier development
                        process. Version 0 was brought in as the main basis for discussions surrounding vendors and our
                        targeted restaurant owner, letting them ‘nitpick’ which features are essential to be refined and
                        focused upon the decision-making based on their agreements.

                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <h3>Version 1</h3>

                    <p>

                        Results of the reviews are then brought for further refinements, creating the version 1 of the
                        prototype. Alongside these design changes, user stories are then also prioritized and turned
                        into checkpoints that will be used to create user tasks, in preparation for the user testing.
                        Version 1 was made in reference to Remix’s requirements, with both platform and application
                        available for testing. Significant changes made are on: color palette, placement of banner,
                        restaurant information, menu item aesthetics, payment flow.

                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <h3>Version 2</h3>

                    <p>

                        The version 2 seeks small minor changes based on usability scores received from the first user
                        test. Changes made were primarily focused upon technical fixes (Adding multiple paths to fix
                        indirect success issues, switching to Useberry from Maze) and the removal of gesture-based
                        interactions, as the main issue of v1 lies within that area. The results of the testing is then
                        brought for another review session with stakeholders mainly to discuss any last changes before
                        it is being brought for finalization and eventually onto the development phase.
