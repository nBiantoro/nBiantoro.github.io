        <div class="container text-justify px-0 py-5 col">
            <p>
                Obero is a Dutch software company specializing in IT Services & Consultancy, providing Software as a
                Service (SaaS) solutions for online ordering and delivery. Founded in 2020 by Alexander Clemencia,
                Izahir Clemencia, and Mohamed Dahou, the company aims to improve business customer experiences by
                offering in-store ordering solutions for enhanced sales efficiency. The company is headquartered in the
                Netherlands and currently employs 17 people.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Obero’s long-term mission is to enable businesses to use software solutions that drive operational
                efficiency and improvements in decision-making, provide unparalleled value to clients, and contribute to
                the growth of technology in the food industry.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Obero’s leading software solution is a subscription package containing a customer-oriented management
                platform and an online ordering application, which restaurant owners (also known as restaurateurs) can
                use to handle their daily in-store operations. This solution is currently being used by over ten
                clients, with daily management and surveillance of the system being handled by Obero employees. The
                platform was built using the PHP programming language with the YII framework and has been running
                stable, as their existing maintenance staff mentioned.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The main functionality of this platform is that it enables associates to have an overview of their
                in-store operations, from broad to detailed specifics, both accessible by restaurateurs and Obero
                employees. Most of the maintenance work and ticketing requires assistance, which, when looking at its
                scalability prospect, is redundant for allowing future growth.
            </p>
