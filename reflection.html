                <p>
                    Working at Obero has given me the opportunity to immerse myself within a dynamic work environment,
                    conducting fast-paced research and discussions at a high iteration level with associates. At an
                    instance, there seemed to be no sense of hierarchial authority whatsoever; it genuinely feels like
                    one works in unison with everyone. Earlier stages do feel a little bit more challenging as there was
                    no proper onboarding between colleagues, everyone just does what they needed to do. But after a
                    couple weeks of meetings and exchange with mentors and staff members, I feel properly introduced and
                    independent enough to control the flow of my project.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    There were no major internal communication problems that occured. Everyone was welcome to share
                    their knowledge whenever and wherever they may be. I also liked the fact that they kept in touch
                    with old interns who have worked in previous years, not only keeping the options open for any
                    opportunities, but to also value the effort and work that they’ve accomplished.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Obero is a fairly small team, if you only count on-site employees, but it does what it does best:
                    keeping communications open anywhere and anytime without a hassle.

                    I’ve managed to present and deliver various professional products that are shown throughout the
                    entirety of the phases within the project: Reports on user research, competitive analysis,
                    literature studies, user testing results and finally the advice document, all detailing the
                    methodologies, processes and results that are gathered according to each topic. These products are
                    also checked at every stage by stakeholders, and especially finalized by the company mentor. The
                    professional products are also used to further progress through the phases, resulting in more
                    deliverables such as information architectures, heuristic evaluation, user stories and prototype
                    designs.

                    Having a project that lies under the UI/UX field, I am familiar with research that permeates around
                    the design-thinking process, only that I am challenging myself to use Double Diamond, as the method
                    seemed to be more effective for evaluation and concept-based scenarios. Combined with the Agile
                    Scrum, one that I am fully aware of, I am able to create and conduct sessions to generate
                    discussions, arguments and decision-makings based on the deliverables I create. Internal
                    stakeholders from business-marketing and data analyst would come together and discuss future
                    strategies, both from exposition schemes and the overall platform’s infrastructure. Getting
                    acquainted with the front-end developers also benefit in understanding their work methods, heavily
                    relying on the designs created within the Figma environment. Research are mostly done using existing
                    and conventional methods, but it is an entirely new experience conducting it within the foodservice

                    The problem has been identified and addressed thoroughly within the earlier phases of discovery and
                    definition, obtaining answers via research methods derived from the DOT framework in parallel with
                    Double Diamond and Agile Scrum. Research questions were raised and answered, each by adapting to the
                    usages of Discovery, Definition, Develop and eventual Deliver. The results of deliverables can be
                    seen within [professional products], and explanation of the processes can be seen at each research
                    question within [research questions].

                    The entirety of this internship assignment practically screams independence on my work methods and
                    approach to every research question, expecting nothing but results at the end of every sprint. I’ve
                    managed to handle all deliverables alongside its inputs and feedbacks from various stakeholders.
                    Especially through the final stages of delivery (post-testing) where interactions with front-end
                    team are more apparent, as well as demands for another sessions rose from the vendors, in order to
                    realize this solution to the market. All these circumstances have allowed me to reflect on my
                    performance as a UI/UX designer and researcher, but also opening some thoughts and opportunities in
                    the role of advisories / managers. I’ve managed to construct a healthy relationship with my
                    superiors, and I respect the value that they’ve given towards their employees, myself included.

                <p>
                    This project involves alot of different entities throughout every phase, that are dependent of one
                    another for the future deployment of Obero. It allows me to communicate with data analysts and
                    technical advisors of the previous platform, address issues from the heuristic evaluation, and
                    suggest a card sorting session to validate the features that are going to be prioritized upon.
                    Design validations from stakeholders and associates are taken into an iterative process, where user
                    inputs and feedbacks are used to evaluate the marketing strategies for vendors, eventually selecting
                    which features to start with implementation for the development team. Requirements are met, and the
                    interactions that are done with the restaurant owner of Remix proved to be an effective basis for
                    the future testing and development of the platform and app.
