                <p>
                    Working at Obero has allowed me to immerse myself in a dynamic work environment, conducting
                    fast-paced research and discussions with associates at a high iteration level. Earlier stages are
                    more challenging as there was no proper onboarding between colleagues, with the challenge continuing
                    until it reaches the later stages of development. Due to a focused client, deeper research on
                    various restaurants could not be conducted, which may result in lesser focused findings that would
                    generate better coverage for the platform’s use case. The initial plan for implementing the MVP was
                    also changed due to time limitations and the amount of research that was taken, which shifted focus
                    towards a more ‘blueprint’ building of the design components and architecture.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    As an ICT Media Design, I feel at ease knowing that my expertise in the field of UI/UX could prove
                    to be beneficial for Obero, learning that the company have learned some valuable inputs from myself.
                    I also liked the fact that they kept in touch with old interns who have worked in previous years,
                    not only keeping the options open for any opportunities, but to also value the effort and work that
                    they’ve accomplished. I wish the best for the team and hope to cross paths in future endeavours.

                    I’ve managed to present and deliver various professional products that are shown throughout the
                    entirety of the phases within the project: Reports on user research, competitive analysis,
                    literature studies, user testing results and finally the advice document, all detailing the
                    methodologies, processes and results that are gathered according to each topic. These products are
                    also checked at every stage by stakeholders, and especially finalized by the company mentor. The
                    professional products are also used to further progress through the phases, resulting in more
                    deliverables such as information architectures, heuristic evaluation, user stories and prototype
                    designs.

                    Having a project that lies under the UI/UX field, I am familiar with research that permeates around
                    the design-thinking process, only that I am challenging myself to use Double Diamond, as the method
                    seemed to be more effective for evaluation and concept-based scenarios. Combined with the Agile
                    Scrum, one that I am fully aware of, I am able to create and conduct sessions to generate
                    discussions, arguments and decision-makings based on the deliverables I create. Internal
                    stakeholders from business-marketing and data analyst would come together and discuss future
                    strategies, both from exposition schemes and the overall platform’s infrastructure. Getting
                    acquainted with the front-end developers also benefit in understanding their work methods, heavily
                    relying on the designs created within the Figma environment. Research are mostly done using existing
                    and conventional methods, but it is an entirely new experience conducting it within the foodservice

                <p>
                    The entirety of this internship assignment practically screams independence on my work methods and
                    approach to every research question, expecting nothing but results at the end of every sprint. I’ve
                    managed to handle all deliverables alongside its inputs and feedbacks from various stakeholders.
                    Especially through the final stages of delivery (post-testing) where interactions with front-end
                    team are more apparent, as well as demands for another sessions rose from the vendors, in order to
                    realize this solution to the market. All these circumstances have allowed me to reflect on my
                    performance as a UI/UX designer and researcher, but also opening some thoughts and opportunities in
                    the role of advisories / managers. I’ve managed to construct a healthy relationship with my
                    superiors, and I respect the value that they’ve given towards their employees, myself included.

                <p>
                    This project involves alot of different entities throughout every phase, that are dependent of one
                    another for the future deployment of Obero. It allows me to communicate with data analysts and
                    technical advisors of the previous platform, address issues from the heuristic evaluation, and
                    suggest a card sorting session to validate the features that are going to be prioritized upon.
                    Design validations from stakeholders and associates are taken into an iterative process, where user
                    inputs and feedbacks are used to evaluate the marketing strategies for vendors, eventually selecting
                    which features to start with implementation for the development team. Requirements are met, and the
                    interactions that are done with the restaurant owner of Remix proved to be an effective basis for
                    the future testing and development of the platform and app.
