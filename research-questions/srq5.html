            <h4>SRQ5 — What features define an efficient in-store ordering system?</h4>
            <p>The features that define an efficient in-store ordering system should consists of the following:</p>
            <br>
            <ol class="list-group px-5" type="1">
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>User-friendly and intuitive interface</b> <br>
                        A friendly and fairly understandable interface engages an automatic swift response from users,
                        knowing that it is an intuitive system. This could stem from aesthetic purposes, but mostly are
                        determined from layout placements based on respect to the heuristic principles, as well as
                        common practices found from other competitors.

                    </p>
                </li>

                <br>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Fast and accurate order processing to avoid inefficiency due to errors</b> <br>
                        Having a reliable ordering system means that data that is sent must be accurately shown and
                        displayed to users to avoid errors. Having to configure the sizes of certain elements, and
                        placements combined does determine the relevancy of data that is shown; a reference to Hick's
                        Law.

                    </p>
                </li>

                <br>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Streamlining processes via integrations with other POS systems</b> <br>
                        Allowing third-party integrations enables faster productivity and openness of the platform to
                        connect with other parties, not as a competition but as an opportunity to excel in creating
                        modular and cooperative systems.

                    </p>
                </li>

                <br>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Room for personalization and customization</b> <br>
                        Having personalization may introduce a sense of 'home' or familiarity for users, and gaining
                        some control or freedom within the domain, with respect to Jakob Nielsen's Heuristic Principles.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Multiple ordering channels</b> <br>
                        Accepting an order from a customer is one thing, but accepting orders from multiple customers at
                        once may prove to be a challenge, but results in a faster rate of production and income. The
                        only importance is to have a feasible and large enough space to store these informations without
                        losing priority one after the other.

                    </p>
                </li>

                <br>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Gamification & User-oriented programs</b> <br>
                        Having a sense of fun user feedback is a rare occurence within ordering applications, as it only
                        serves as a singular purpose of ordering food/beverages. By utilizing gamification ideas,
                        chances to engage with customers could create a lasting impression and serving a space to insert
                        potential upselling ideas, so that customers may want to order more after their first order.

                    </p>
                </li>

                <br>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Reporting and analytics</b> <br>
                        As mentioned in the earlier research question, having a space that acts as a summary of data is
                        essential to identify trends and set out
                        realistic goals for any organizations. Aided with the right data visualization and ease of data
                        movability (via export), analytics can be a powerful tool for serving real-time data, increasing
                        productivity and reducing action time for for decision-making.

                    </p>
                </li>

                <br>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Integrations with other services (delivery/pickup)</b> <br>
                        Opening opportunities to other types of services outside in-store ordering requires more
                        handling and infrastructure to manege, but will certainly increase outreach to customers outside
                        of the restaurant. However, since this relates to customers outside of the restaurant, it is not
                        relevant for Obero's current scope.

                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p>
                By incorporating these features, in-store systems become efficient, enhance the customer experience, and
                streamline order operations and accuracy, ultimately enhancing productivity.
