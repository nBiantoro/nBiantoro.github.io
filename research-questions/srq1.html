                    <p><b>Vendors</b></p>
                    <p>Vendors prioritize on utilizing and selling Obero’s platform to restaurateurs, of which requires
                        high technical knowledge and workarounds of the platform itself, ensuring high quality customer
                        acquisition and relationship. They are mainly affiliated directly with the progress of the
                        assignment (MVP requirements, identifying USPs, employing marketing strategies, etc.)</p>
                    <p>
                        Vendors demand a complete technical knowledge and expertise of the platform’s workarounds, and a
                        more usable system to ensure better management of their customers.

                    <p><b>Restaurateurs</b></p>
                    <p>Restaurateurs (aka restaurant owners) are owners of in-store businesses that require
                        surveillance of their day-to-day operations. Consists of owners and staff members that work
                        together within a hierarchial structure, and are mainly motivated in establishing seamless,
                        efficient and high quality management handling.</p>
                    <p>Restaurateurs demand a more streamlined and efficient dashboard platform that can be easily
                        integrated into their POS system, and a digitalized way of reducing minor interactions between
                        customers and staff members.</p>

                <br>

                    <p><b>Consumers</b></p>
                    <p>
                        Consumers (aka customers of restaurants) are the main motivation behind every restaurateur,
                        ensuring high quality goods and services for a positive experience and (eventually) determining
                        the outlook of a restaurant’s popularity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Consumers are the most powerful out of the three, as they are the main indicator of generating
                        revenue for restaurateurs: consumers would strive for a positive dining experience that mainly
                        focuses on the quality of food and services, weighing its value for their money and time.

                            To answer this question, <a href="../prof-products/phase-1/user-research.html" target="_blank"><b>user research</b></a>
                             was conducted with internal stakeholders and
                            affiliates of the company to conduct preliminary profiling of the different users that are
                            using the solution. This was achieved via expert interviews with vendors, peer reviews to
                            involve the stakeholders within the process, and, once identified, continued with online
                            surveys (targeted towards restaurateurs and consumers) and  <a href="../prof-products/phase-1/lit-study.html" target="_blank"><b>literature study</b></a> to further
