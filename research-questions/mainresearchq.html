            <h4>How can Obero’s Platform be improved on to allow better usability and efficiency for managing
                restaurateurs & their in-store operations within the foodservice industry?</h4>
            <br>

            <p>After conducting extensive research on target groups and their relationships, performing a competitive
                analysis on different competitors, evaluating the platform according to usability heuristics, and
                engaging in iterative sessions with stakeholders and targeted clients, several vital improvements have
                been identified for Obero’s platform:</p>

            <br>

            <ol class="list-group px-5" type="a">
                <li>
                    <p><b>User-Centered Design (UCD)</b></p>
                    <p>
                        Implementing a user-centered approach creates a more intuitive environment tailored to
                        restaurateurs’ specific needs for their in-store operations. By understanding user workflows and
                        incorporating user feedback, the platform can be optimized for usability and efficiency.
                    </p>

                <li>
                    <p><b>Centralized Dashboard</b></p>
                    <p>
                        Developing a centralized dashboard will provide restaurateurs with a comprehensive overview of
                        critical metrics and vital information, presenting real-time operational data such as sales,
                        inventory, customer feedback, and others, presented in a visually appealing and easily processed
                        format, enabling swift and informed decision-making for users.

                    <p><b>Modular and Configurable Microservices</b></p>
                    <p>
                        Combined with the dashboard, this will allow restaurateurs to customize based on their
                        preferences. This flexibility ensures that the platform can adapt to different establishments
                        within the food service industry, providing tailored solutions for specific and situational
                        needs.

                    <p><b>Integrations with Other POS Systems</b></p>
                    <p>
                        Integrating the platform with POS systems familiar to what restaurateurs have used within their
                        operations will automate data syncrhonization, eliminating manual data entry and improves their
                        operational efficiency.

                    <p>
                        Incorporating data visualization capabilities into the platform will enable restaurateurs to
                        generate detailed reports, visualize trends and gain insights into their operations, empowering
                        data-driven decision-making and helps identifying areas for improvements.

                    <p>
                        Ensuring accessibility across multiple devices will allow users the flexibility to monitor and
                        manage their operations anywhere, anytime. This accessibility (especially for mobile devices)
                        enhances convenience and productivity.

                    <p><b>Continuous User Feedback & Iteration Cycles</b></p>
                    <p>
                        Establishing a feedback loop with end-users and incorporate inputs throughout the development
                        process to ensure that the platform evolves based on real user needs. Conducting it on regular
                        cycles will enable timely updates and improvements to enhance and address emerging challenges.

            <br>
            <p>
                By implementing these improvements, Obero’s platform can deliver a more user-friendly, efficient and
                eventually scalable solutions for managing restaurateurs and their in-store operations.
